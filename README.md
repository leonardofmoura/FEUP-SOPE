# FEUP-SOPE
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Operating Systems course.

The course focuses on Operating Systems concepts using UNIX based systems and the C language to interact with the kernel.

## Exercises

Exercises solved to gain some practical insight on Operating Systems concepts using the C language in the UNIX environment. They are divided in different chapters, each one targeting different concepts.

- **Chapter 1:** Shell commands and general Unix C programming concepts
- **Chapter 2:** Terminal, files and directories
- **Chapter 3:** Process creation and termination
- **Chapter 4:** Signals 
- **Chapter 5:** Pipes and FIFOs 
- **Chapter 6:** Threads
- **Chapter 7:** Synchronization mechanisms, shared memory and message queues

## Projects

Projects developed to apply Operating Systems on a bigger scale in more complex Systems. They were developed with my partners [Jo√£o Martins](https://github.com/joaomrcsmartins) and [Sofia Lajes](https://github.com/SALajes).

- **Forensic:** Forensic utility that analyses files and directories in the Unix environment, gathering and displaying information about them. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/leonardofmoura/SOPE-Forensic).  
- **Home Banking:** Client-server banking app that simulates banking operations over the internet. The simulation is made using processes on the same machine, using different threads that communicate using named *pipes* (FIFOs). The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/joaomrcsmartins/SOPE-HomeBanking)
